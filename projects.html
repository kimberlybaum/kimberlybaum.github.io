                <p>
                        Open source contribution to Billboard.js, a javascript data visualization library. I created a plug in which prevents chart/data labels from overlapping by calculating their optimal placement using a voronoi layout.

                <h2>Notational Programming Research</h2>
                <p>Available programming languages strive for clear mappings between natural language and formal syntax; nonetheless, conventional programming becomes increasingly unintuitive when utilized within visual or scientific fields involving diagrams and diagrammatic notations. Moreover, visual programming languages usually serve only specific domains, or do not effectively support expert-level engineering practices. This paper reports on preliminary research exploring the design and implementation of handwritten programming paradigm, considering existing languages and human computer interaction (HCI) principles. Utilizing both notation and geometric figures, our research hopes to explore new ways of programming by questioning the historically- and culturally-situated centrality of typing code.</p>

                    <p>3D printed a small scale wind sculpture using
                         Fusion 360. When assembled, the spinners 
                         should rotate around the ring when in the
                          presence of wind. This project was inspired
